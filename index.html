<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_introduction">Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The game of Cthulhu has evolved over many years, getting a lot of variants
along the way. This book presents a variant that&#8217;s close to the original (4
factions) with some interesting modifications (additional factions), giving
them as an optional expansion. It&#8217;s hard to say, which variant of the rules is
the best, in different groups different parts of the game are prioritised,
players have their own different favourite strategies. But a game with
imperfect rules is almost always much better than a long discussion about the
rules, hence the choice of the ruleset should be Manitou&#8217;s, not an object of
discussion of all the players.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Cthulhu is a social game based on Mafia (aka Werewolf), but it significantly
expands upon its roots. Each of the players is in the role of a member of the
Boom-Boom City Council. There are different factions in the council, they have
contradicting goals and each player tries to lead towards their faction&#8217;s
victory. The game is orchestrated by the Manitou, who does not participate in
the game itself, but can resolve conflicts regarding the rules and ensures the
game is going smoothly.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the background of the game is the following story of the City, which may be
presented by Manitou. <em>The optional elements regarding added fractions are
italicised.</em></p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_backstory">Backstory</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>From time immemorial, a tribe of Native Americans have worshipped a statuette
of the god Cthulhu, made from rare and precious metals. But then, Europeans
came to America, killed most of the natives and took the statuette from them.
In the place where the natives previously lived, they started Boom-Boom City.
The statuette was a very popular tourist attraction, bringing a lot of
attention towards the city. This inspired a group of bandits to come to the
city and steal the statuette. But in reality, the statuette is an alien
transmitter from the spaceship of Ufocs, which crashed in North America a long
time ago.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Lucky Luke arrives in Boom-Boom City, and sees that the conflict about the
statuette is very complex and cannot be simply resolved. Therefore, he decides
to find the statuette and donate it charitatively. He thinks this is the only
way to resolve the increasing tension in the city. There is another group
living in the city, usually ignored by the others - the enslaved Afroamericans.
They plan on escaping the white people&#8217;s oppression, but to do so they must get
enough money&#8230; That&#8217;s enough of what&#8217;s earthly, but this is not the end of the
story. Not many know that Boom-Boom City is closely observed by gods. In
ancient times, a group of gods, called the Bungler Gods (called like this not
only for this reason) allowed for a small amount of a supernatural substance to
appear on Earth, and then all trace of it was lost. It&#8217;s not necessary to
explain how the existance of this substance in the world of humans and Ufocs
violates the pride of the gods. The Gods coincidentally just localised the
substance in Boom-Boom City, on one of the planets orbiting an insignificant
star. At least it can be destroyed, before it disappears again somewhere in the
spacetime. Can the Bungler Gods regain their pride by finishing this task?</em></p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The game starts on the zeroth night, on which the statuette was stolen.
There are three or four (<em>or up to seven</em>) factions in the game, depending
on the number of players. They are the: citizens, bandits, natives,
potentially Ufocs, <em>even more potentially Lucky Luke, slaves and Bungler Gods</em>.
The goal of the citizens is to get the statuette back. Bandits want to
cruise back to Europe on a ship that will be waiting for them,
the natives want to kill all the members of the other factions. The Ufocs
want to use the statuette to transmit a signal to their original planet.
<em>Lucky Luke wants to leave with the statuette by sunset, slaves want to
scratch off enough gold from the statuette to be able to escape. Bungler
Gods want to completely destroy the statuette.</em></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The game has a day-night cycle. During the day, the council discusses who to
search, and potentially hang (the decisions are made by voting). There may also
be duels. During the night, specific people and groups act in secret - everyone
except the involved has to sit with their eyes closed, and Manitou conducts the
game, by calling consecutive characters or groups. Players can be eliminated
from the game (killed <em>or escaped</em>), these players reveal their identity card
and don&#8217;t take part in the further game, but are welcome to observe. Apart from
this situation and specific abilities of some characters, it is not allowed to
show your identity card. Illegaly showing an identity card causes immediate
death by a falling piano (it&#8217;s the same for any other illegal moves).</p></div>

<h2 id="_specific_goals_of_the_factions">Specific goals of the factions</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_city">The City</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Wins, when the statuette is discovered during the day - through searches,
checking the bodies of players who lost in duels and killed by the shamaness
and in the case a citizen gets the statuette and survives until the morning.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_bandits">Bandits</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Win when they can sail away with the statuette. Their ship is only ready
to sail on the third night, but they can only sail away in the morning, which
means that they must keep the statuette through all other factions' phases
during the night.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_natives">Natives</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The natives want to kill all other players, they win when only natives are
left alive in the game. If the last non-native player having a statuette
is poisoned by the shamaness and thus dies during the day, the city wins
(punishment for natives' stupidity).</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_ufocs">Ufocs</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Win if they are able to send a signal to their home planet three times.
In order to transmit, they must have the statuette at the end of their phase.
When they succeed, their ship flies to Earth and takes them and the statuette.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_lucky_luke">Lucky Luke</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Wins if he can ride away with the statuette at sunset (just before the night).</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_slaves">Slaves</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Win if the last slave escapes (even if only natives are left when this happens).
A slave can run away the night following when there was gold scratched
off the statuette as many times as the number of since then killed slaves plus one. (1 + SlavesAlive(now) - SlavesAlive(last escape))</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_bungler_gods">Bungler Gods</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Win when they destroy the statuette by shooting it three times.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_general_note">General note</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Only one faction can win in this game, in case of a dispute the Manitou decides.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_beginning_of_the_game">Beginning of the game</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the beginning Manitou distributes shuffled identity cards among all the
players, reminds them of the rules and begins the game. First is the zeroth
night, when all the non-city factions get to know each other and very few
characters actually have actions. Then the first day is announced and the
players (optionally) introduce themselves - something like "I&#8217;m Bob, a smith"
rather than "My name is Robert Smith, my card is a sheriff". The rest of the
game follows.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_specific_day_rules">Specific day rules</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>During the day most of the time mostly ungoverned discussion takes place.</p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_duels">Duels</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A more formal event that can happen is a duel: any player can challenge any
other player at any moment of the day. During a given day only two duels can
take place (it doesn&#8217;t matter how many were refused). While the sheriff is
alive, players are allowed to refuse duels. If the sheriff is not alive or the
duel was accepted by the other player, the duelling players stand in front of
each other. First the attacker says their speech, explaining why they should
win. Then, the attacked has a chance to say their defence speech, no one else
has the right to speak during the duel! When the speeches are done, the duel
begins. Everyone except the duelling players votes for either one of the
players, or they bystand. If everyone bystands, both duelling players live. If
there is at least one vote, the player with the majority of the votes for them
dies. If there is a draw, both players die. There are characters, which have
special abilities during the duels.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_searches">Searches</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>At the end of the day, the council can choose to search one or more players
to check if they have the statuette. Every player has as many votes, as
many players can be searched in total by the rules, and the players with the
most votes are searched. In case of a draw, a second round of voting is done
by the Manitou, and in case the draw cannot be resolved (by Manitou&#8217;s judgement)
the players with the drawing votes and all players with less votes are excluded
from the searches. After the searches, Manitou says whether any of the searched
players had the statuette. If they had it, the city wins. Otherwise, the council
votes whether they want to hang one of the searched players. If they decide yes (without a draw),
another vote is conducted to determine which of the players to hang according
to the same rules as before, but in case of a draw no one is hanged.
The players are allowed to bystand and not vote <strong>only</strong> in the duels.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_specific_night_rules">Specific night rules</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>During the night, Manitou will wake specific factions or characters. The
players must remember to remain silent during the night. Usually the sleeping
cover their faces with their hands to make it clear who&#8217;s sleeping and who&#8217;s
not. Each of the waked players has to follow Manitou&#8217;s instructions and then go
back to sleep. It&#8217;s possible that a person is not active (e.g. was drunk or
locked up by a sheriff), then don&#8217;t wake up during that night at all. If that
player has the statuette, the statuette cannot be taken from them and they
cannot pass it to anyone.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The first to act during the night is <em>Lucky Luke, then</em> all the "nightly"
citizens, following that the bandits, natives, Ufocs, <em>slaves, and Bungler
Gods</em>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Each faction apart from the city acts as a whole, the decisions are made by the
majority and if that can&#8217;t decide, Manitou will ask the highest ranking member
of the faction for the final choice. If the faction has the statuette, then the
highest ranking member decides who will own it. <em>If Lucky Luke has the
statuette in the beginning of his phase, he wins, otherwise he searches a
chosen person.</em> Bandits, if they don&#8217;t have the statuette, can choose a person
to steal from - if they have the statuette, it goes to the bandits. The natives
kill a chosen person every night, if the killed person has the statuette, the
natives take it. If they have (or just got through murder) the statuette, they
get to kill another person that night. If Ufocs are in the game, search one
person every night without the ability to kill them. _If a slave wants to
escape, then they do it in the beginning of the slaves' turn (one is chosen by
the group), then the slaves can try stealing the statuette from one person. If
they have the statuette at the end of their turn, they scratch gold off it. The
Bungler Gods shoot at someone every night. With a 75% probability they succeed,
then if the person has the statuette the Gods can (but don&#8217;t have to) steal it.
If the shot is not successful, the target dies.</p></div>
