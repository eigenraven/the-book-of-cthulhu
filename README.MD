# The Game of Cthulhu
 
Cthulhu is a social game based on Mafia (aka Werewolf), but it significantly
expands upon its roots. Each of the players is in the role of a member of the
Boom-Boom City Council. There are different factions in the council, they have
contradicting goals and each player tries to lead towards their faction's
victory. The game is orchestrated by the Manitou, who does not participate in
the game itself, but can resolve conflicts regarding the rules and ensures the
game is going smoothly.
